A multiplayer 3D maze game built with Three.js and WebSocket for real-time multiplayer functionality.

## Recent Code Cleanup & Optimizations üõ†Ô∏è

### Performance Improvements
- **Reduced Position Update Frequency**: Changed from 50ms to 100ms intervals for better performance
- **Optimized Rotation Buffer**: Reduced buffer size from 5 to 3 rotations for memory efficiency  
- **Throttled Arrow Updates**: Increased arrow update interval to 100ms
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Added proper cleanup for animation frames, event listeners, and intervals

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Reduced Console Spam**: Removed excessive logging that was flooding the console during gameplay
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added emojis and structured logging for better debugging experience
- **Proper Cleanup**: Added comprehensive cleanup functions for renderer, event listeners, and multiplayer connections
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling patterns throughout the codebase

### Bug Fixes
